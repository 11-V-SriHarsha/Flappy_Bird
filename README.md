- Dynamic obstacle generation
- Progressive difficulty increase
- Visual effects including:
  - Score glow animations
  - Bird rotation based on velocity
  - Game over screen with effects
- Speed multiplier system
- High score tracking

## üîß Technical Details

- Built with .NET 9.0 Windows Forms
- Written in C# with modern coding practices
- Uses GDI+ for enhanced graphics rendering
- Implements proper resource management and disposal
- Double buffered rendering for smooth animations

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Windows OS
- .NET 9.0 SDK or later
- Visual Studio 2022 or later

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone [your-repository-url]

```bash
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

## üéØ How to Play

- Press **SPACE** to make the bird jump
- Avoid hitting the pipes
- Score increases as you pass through pipes
- Game speed increases every 5 points
- Press **R** to restart after game over

## üé® Game Mechanics

- Bird Physics:
  - Constant gravity effect
  - Jump force for upward movement
  - Rotation based on velocity

- Difficulty Progression:
  - Base speed: 7 units
  - Speed increases every 5 points
  - Maximum speed multiplier: 3.0x
  - Progressive gap positioning

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

- **Graphics**: Uses GDI+ with double buffering
- **Animation**: Custom timer-based animation system
- **Memory Management**: Proper resource disposal
- **Collision Detection**: Rectangle-based collision system
- **Performance**: Optimized rendering and update loops
